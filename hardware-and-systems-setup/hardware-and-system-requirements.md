# Hardware & system requirements

## Requirements

Despite being catered towards home-staking, running an ETH validator node reliably still requires some thought on the choice of hardware. To run this locally in your own home, you will need the following:

1. CPU: Intel i5
2. RAM: 32GB&#x20;
3. Storage: 2TB NVME SSD
4. Network requirements:&#x20;
   * **Volume**: Uncapped or at least 2 TB per month&#x20;
   * **Speeds:** At least 500mb/s shared - \*Your validator node needs at least 10Mb/s of dedicated internet speed.&#x20;
   * **Security:** Subnet
5. Operating system: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
6. Power: Uninterruptible power supply (UPS)

## Shopping List

1. CPU + Case: Intel NUC i5 12th generation bare bones
2. RAM: 2x 16GB Lexar DDR4-3200 SODIMM&#x20;
3. Storage: ADATA S70 2TB NVMe Gen4 SSD
4. Networking: TP-Link Wifi 6 AX1500 Smart WiFi Router
5. Power: APC Easy UPS BVX 1200VA, 230V, AVR, Universal Sockets
6. Miscellaneous: 3x CAT7 LAN cables, 2x new 8GB USB drive

The full set above should cost around **SGD1450 or USD1067**

## Cost considerations

1. **Revenue:** A single ETH validator will generate between 4.5% (median) to 5.7% (mean) yield. At ETH price = USD1600, this will give you an income of between USD2304 to USD2918 per year.
2. **Cost:** The hardware cost described here is around USD1067 and electricity is negligible at around USD90 (SGD120) per year
3. **Payback Period:** Around 5 months

**However, you will be able to run your node with as many validator keys (32 ETH each) on just a single set of hardware** - e.g. running with 2 validator keys doubles your revenue without increasing your cost base. As a result, this halves your payback period.
