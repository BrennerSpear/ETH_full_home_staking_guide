## Credits

This guide references and builds upon several other guides that came before mine and I could not have been able to run my own validator nodes without them. Please check out some of these OG contributors here - [Ethstaker](https://docs.ethstaker.cc/ethstaker-knowledge-base/), [CoinCashew](https://www.coincashew.com/coins/overview-eth/guide-or-how-to-setup-a-validator-on-eth2-mainnet), [Somer Esat](https://github.com/SomerEsat/ethereum-staking-guides), [Remy Roy](https://github.com/eth-educators/ethstaker-guides/blob/main/prepare-for-the-merge.md), [Rocketpool ](https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/)

## Why write another ETH staking guide?

While there are already existing guides out there on how to set up an ETH validator node, I find that they sometimes assume some basic level of working technical knowledge.&#x20;

This can result in seemingly obvious but important steps being skipped, which prevents completely non-technical but aspiring node operators from pushing through.

Hence, I put this guide together catering to the laymen. With this, I hope to bring you guys from zero-to-one on your journey as an ETH validator node operator!

**My goals for this guide:**

1. Highly copy-paste-able shell bash commands + step-by-step instructions for all non-command-line procedures
2. Focused on safety - prevent slashing and inactivity leaks
3. How to think about solo-staking in the era of liquid staking
4. Covers the conceptual understanding of how validators work under the hood and how slashing happens
5. How to decide which validator clients to use as a newcomer

**Coming up next, I will also be building more guides covering the following:**

1. different client sets
2. practice exercises for node operators
3. enterprise-level setups&#x20;
4. specific use cases - e.g. migrating clients, failover nodes, external signer & HSM, MEV Boost, Telegram/Discord monitoring bots
